# SortingVisualizer

A very simple sorting visualizer made with C++ using SFML and ImGui.  
The program allows you to visualize the following sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort
- Radix Sort

### How to build and run

1. Download the source code and the SFML library from [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).
2. Extract the SFML library to a desired location and edit the `CMakeLists.txt` file to point to the location of the library.
3. Build the project using CMake and your desired compiler.
4. Make sure a sound file named `sort.wav` is in the same directory as the executable.
